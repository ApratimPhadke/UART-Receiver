üìå Project Overview

This project implements a UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter) Receiver in Verilog HDL.
UART is one of the most widely used protocols for serial communication. It allows devices like microcontrollers, sensors, and PCs to communicate using just two wires (TX & RX) without a shared clock.

This repository demonstrates:

RTL design of a UART Receiver.

Explanation of the working principle.

A testbench to simulate the design.

UART Basics

UART communication sends data bit by bit (serially).
